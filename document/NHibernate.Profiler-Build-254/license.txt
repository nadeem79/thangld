Beta License for the NHibernate Profiler

Copyright (c) Oren Eini - 2008

I am currently not happy with any of the standard software licenses, as such, I decided to put this place holder at the moment, until I have the time & inclination to actually deal with this silly but important thing.

NHibernate Profiler is licensed per user, you may use it on multiple machines, including simultanously, as long as there is only a single user doing the work. By user I meant any person or agent that is using NHibernate Profiler. 

The evaluation version is limited to 30 days, after which you must purchase the full version or stop using NHibernate Profiler. 

The current version is not even a beta, and as such, it may decide to do anything it feel likes, including things you probably wish that it wouldn't do. Please take that into account when evaluating the software, the main purpose of pushing this out is to get as much feedback, as early as possible. Feel free to mail me at ayende@ayende.com with issues or comments.
