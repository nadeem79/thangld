mfgames-template (1.1.0)

  * Dylan R. E. Moonfire
    + Requires MfGames.Utility 1.3.0 or higher.
    + Fixed bug #60 with newlines in the assign statements.
    + Added the <%# ... %> which lets the user create funtions and
      methods outside of the parsing routine. This is similiar to
      ASP.NET's <script runat='server'></script> functionality.
    + Added the ability to precompile templates using the mfgames-template
      tool.
    + Added a <%@ Template Namespace="AAA" %> to allow included namespaces
      at the template level without needing additional values from the
      TemplateFactory.
    + Added a <%@ Variable Name="Var1" Type="System.String" %> construct
      to allow defining variables from the context at the template level
      instead of requiring effort at the TemplateFactory level.
	
mfgames-template (1.0.0)

  * Dylan R. E. Moonfire
    + Converted build system to automake/autoconf.
    + TemplateFactory.cs: Explictly added a reference to the
      MfGames.Utility assembly during the factory compilation. (Closes
      #51).
    + Added a new feature for allowing templates to include other
      templates. A template may use the built-in Include(string
      templateName) function. The search path may be added with
      TemplateFactory.AddTemplateSearch("path/to/{0}.template").
  * Harald Fielker
    + Harald supplied VS 2003 files for this package.	
	
mfgames-template (0.2.0)

  * Added the line pragmas to make it easier to find the line numbers

    the file (or whatever) to the TemplateFactory. (DREM)
